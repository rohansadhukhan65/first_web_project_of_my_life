Sir Isaac Newton PRS MP;[1] 25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726/7;[2] was an English physicist, mathematician
 and astronomer.[3][4] He is famous for his work on the laws of motion, optics, gravity, and calculus. In 1687, 
Newton published a book called the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica in which he presents his theory
 of universal gravitation and three laws of motion.[3]

Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope in 1668; he also developed a theory of light based on the
 observation that a prism decomposes white light into the colors of the rainbow. Newton also shares credit with 
Gottfried Leibniz for the development of calculus.

Newton's ideas on light, motion, and gravity dominated physics for the next three centuries, until modified by

<H1>Mechanics and gravitation</H1><BR>



In 1679, Newton returned to his work on mechanics by considering gravitation and its effect on the orbits
 of planets with reference to Kepler's laws of planetary motion. This followed stimulation by a brief exchange of
 letters in 1679–80 with Hooke, who had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, and who
 opened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions. Newton's 
reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter
 of 1680–1681, on which he corresponded with John Flamsteed. After the exchanges with Hooke, Newton worked 
out proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to 
the square of the radius vector (see Newton's law of universal gravitation – History and De motu corporum in gyrum).
 Newton communicated his results to Edmond Halley and to the Royal Society in De motu corporum in gyrum, a tract 
written on about nine sheets which was copied into the Royal Society's Register Book in December 1684
 This tract contained the nucleus that Newton developed and expanded to form the Principia.

The Principia was published on 5 July 1687 with encouragement and financial help from Edmond Halley. In this
 work, Newton stated the three universal laws of motion. Together, these laws describe the relationship between
 any object, the forces acting upon it and the resulting motion, laying the foundation for classical mechanics.
 They contributed to many advances during the Industrial Revolution which soon followed and were not improved 
upon for more than 200 years. Many of these advancements continue to be the underpinnings of non-relativistic
 technologies in the modern world. He used the Latin word gravitas (weight) for the effect that would become known 
as gravity, and defined the law of universal gravitation.

In the same work, Newton presented a calculus-like method of geometrical analysis using 'first and last ratios', gave
 the first analytical determination (based on Boyle's law) of the speed of sound in air, inferred the oblateness of Earth's
 spheroidal figure, accounted for the precession of the equinoxes as a result of the Moon's gravitational attraction on 
the Earth's oblateness, initiated the gravitational study of the irregularities in the motion of the moon, provided a
 theory for the determination of the orbits of comets, and much more.

Newton made clear his heliocentric view of the Solar System—developed in a somewhat modern way, because already
 in the mid-1680s he recognised the "deviation of the Sun" from the centre of gravity of the Solar System. For Newton,
 it was not precisely the centre of the Sun or any other body that could be considered at rest, but rather "the common 
centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun and all the Planets is to be esteem'd the Centre of the World", and this centre of
 gravity "either is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right line" (Newton adopted the "at rest" alternative in view 
of common consent that the centre, wherever it was, was at rest).

Newton's postulate of an invisible force able to act over vast distances led to him being criticised for introducing
 "occult agencies" into science.[60] Later, in the second edition of the Principia (1713), Newton firmly rejected such
 criticisms in a concluding General Scholium, writing that it was enough that the phenomena implied a gravitational 
attraction, as they did; but they did not so far indicate its cause, and it was both unnecessary and improper to frame
 hypotheses of things that were not implied by the phenomena. (Here Newton used what became his famous
 expression "hypotheses non-fingo".


<H1>Classification of cubics</H1><BR>
Descartes was the most important early influence on Newton the mathematician. Newton classified the cubic
 curves in the plane. He found 72 of the 78 species of cubics. He also divided them into four types, satisfying
 different equations, and in 1717 Stirling, probably with Newton's help, proved that every cubic was one of these
 four types. Newton also claimed that the four types could be obtained by plane projection from one of them, and
 this was proved in 1731.
