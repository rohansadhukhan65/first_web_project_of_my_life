<H3>Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist.[5] Einstein developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics).[2][6]:274 Einstein's work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.[7][8] Einstein is best known by the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2 (which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation").[9] He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect",[10] a pivotal step in the evolution of quantum theory.

Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern (1902–1909), Switzerland. However, he realized that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields and—with his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916—he published a paper on general relativity. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to model the large-scale structure of the universe.[11][12]

Between 1895 and 1914, he lived in Switzerland (except for one year in Prague, 1911–12), where he received his academic diploma from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zürich (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH) in 1900. He later taught there at the same institute as a professor of theoretical physics between 1912 and 1914 before he left for Berlin. In 1901, after being stateless for more than five years, Einstein acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life. In 1905, Einstein was awarded a PhD by the University of Zürich. The same year, his annus mirabilis (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world, at the age of 26.

He was visiting the United States when Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933 and—being Jewish—did not go back to Germany, where he had been a professor at the Berlin Academy of Sciences. He settled in the United States, becoming an American citizen in 1940.[13] On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential development of "extremely powerful bombs of a new type" and recommending that the U.S. begin similar research. This eventually led to what would become the Manhattan Project. Einstein supported defending the Allied forces, but generally denounced the idea of using the newly discovered nuclear fission as a weapon. Later, with the British philosopher Bertrand Russell, Einstein signed the Russell–Einstein Manifesto, which highlighted the danger of nuclear weapons. Einstein was affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, until his death in 1955.

Einstein published more than 300 scientific papers along with over 150 non-scientific works.[11][14] Einstein's
 intellectual achievements and originality have made the word "Einstein" synonymous with "genius".[15]<br></H3><BR><BR>

<H1>Thermodynamic fluctuations and statistical physicsv</H1><BR>
Main articles: Statistical mechanics, thermal fluctuations, and statistical physics
Einstein's first paper
 submitted in 1900 to Annalen der Physik was on capillary attraction. It was published in 1901 with the title
 "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen", which translates as "Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena". Two papers he published in 1902–1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view. These papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist. His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.[146]

<H1>General principles</H1><BR>
He articulated the principle of relativity. This was understood by Hermann Minkowski to be a generalization of
 rotational invariance from space to space-time. Other principles postulated by Einstein and later vindicated are
 the principle of equivalence, general covariance and the principle of adiabatic invariance of the quantum number.

<H1>Theory of relativity and E = mc²</H1><BR>
Main article: History of special relativity
Einstein's "Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper" ("On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies") was received on 
30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year. It reconciles Maxwell's equations for electricity and
magnetism with the laws of mechanics, by introducing major changes to mechanics close to the speed of light. 
This later became known as Einstein's special theory of relativity.

Consequences of this include the time–space frame of a moving body appearing to slow down and contract
 (in the direction of motion) when measured in the frame of the observer. This paper also argued that the idea of 
a luminiferous aether—one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time—was superfluous.

In his paper on mass–energy equivalence, Einstein produced E = mc2 from his special relativity equations. Einstein's
 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with
 Max Planck.[149][150]

Main articles: Photon and Quantum
In a 1905 paper, Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (quanta). Einstein's light 
quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr. This idea only became
 universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Millikan's detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the 
measurement of Compton scattering.

Einstein concluded that each wave of frequency f is associated with a collection of photons with energy hf each,
 where h is Planck's constant. He does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related to 
the wave. But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.[151]

<H1>Quantized atomic vibrations</H1><BR>
Main article: Einstein solid
In 1907, Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. Peter Debye refined this model
